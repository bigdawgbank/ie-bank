# Site Reliability Engineer Documentation

The Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) ensures the reliability, efficiency, and scalability of the software systems by applying engineering principles to IT operations. This includes defining SLAs, SLOs, and SLIs, designing monitoring strategies, and preparing incident response plans.

## Service Level Agreement (SLA)

### 1. SLA Definition

**Description**:

The SLA defines the expected levels of service provided to the end-users for the current version of the application. The commitments are as follows:

- **Uptime Guarantee**: The application will maintain a minimum **99.9% availability per month**, ensuring downtime does not exceed 43 minutes and 49 seconds in a month.
- **Response Time**: Backend API responses will maintain a maximum response time of **less than 300ms for 95% of requests**, measured monthly.
- **Support Availability**: High-priority incidents (e.g., service outages) will be addressed and resolved within **1 hour** of detection, ensuring minimal impact on end-users.
- **Compensation Policy**: In the event of SLA violations, the company will provide service credits proportionate to the downtime or degraded performance experienced by the users.

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

### 1. SLO Definitions

**Description**:

To ensure the SLA is met, the following five Service Level Objectives (SLOs) have been defined:

1. **Application Availability**: Maintain an uptime of **99.9%** for the application on a monthly basis.
2. **Error Rate**: Keep the system error rate below **1%** for all user requests monthly.
3. **API Response Time**: Ensure the average API response time is **less than 200ms**, measured hourly.
4. **HTTP 5xx Error Rate**: Maintain a maximum HTTP 5xx error rate of **less than 0.5%** daily.
5. **Critical Incident Resolution Time**: Resolve high-priority incidents within **1 hour** of detection.

## Service Level Indicators (SLIs)

### 1. SLI Definitions

**Description**:

To measure the achievement of the SLOs, the following five Service Level Indicators (SLIs) have been defined:

1. **Application Availability**:
   - **Indicator**: Percentage uptime measured using the ratio of successful requests (`requests.success == true`) to total requests from Application Insights logs.
2. **Error Rate**:
   - **Indicator**: The percentage of failed requests (`requests.success == false`) against total requests, calculated daily.
3. **Average API Response Time**:
   - **Indicator**: The average duration of all incoming requests (`requests.duration`), measured hourly.
4. **HTTP 5xx Error Rate**:
   - **Indicator**: The percentage of HTTP 5xx errors (`requests.resultCode startswith "5"`) against total requests, calculated daily.
5. **Incident Resolution Time**:
   - **Indicator**: The time elapsed between incident detection and resolution, monitored via incident management tools.

## Monitoring Strategy Design

### 1. Monitoring Strategy

**Description**:

To ensure the applicationâ€™s performance, availability, and reliability, the following monitoring strategy has been implemented:

- **Monitoring Tools**:
  - **Azure Application Insights**: Used for application performance monitoring, capturing telemetry data such as requests, exceptions, dependencies, and custom events.
  - **Azure Log Analytics Workspace**: Centralizes logs from various sources for in-depth analysis.

- **Metrics and Logs**:
  - Key metrics and logs are collected and visualized in Azure Workbooks, including:
    - Application availability
    - Server response times
    - Failed request rates
    - Exception counts
    - Dependency durations

- **Alerts**:
  - Configured alerts for critical performance indicators:
    - **Availability Alerts**: Triggered when uptime drops below 99.9%.
    - **Error Rate Alerts**: Triggered when error rates exceed 1%.
    - **Response Time Alerts**: Triggered when average response times exceed 200ms.

- **Dashboards**:
  - Real-time dashboards have been created using Azure Workbooks to visualize critical metrics, facilitating proactive monitoring.

- **Log Analysis**:
  - Implemented log queries using Kusto Query Language (KQL) to identify trends and potential issues.

## Incident Response Design

### 1. Incident Response Plan

**Description**:

A comprehensive incident response plan has been designed to handle system failures effectively:

- **Incident Detection**:
  - Utilize monitoring tools and configured alerts to detect incidents promptly.
- **Incident Triage**:
  - Incidents are classified based on severity levels:
    - **P1 (Critical)**: Complete service outage or major functionality failure.
    - **P2 (High)**: Significant degradation affecting multiple users.
    - **P3 (Medium)**: Minor issues affecting a small subset of users.

- **Incident Resolution**:
  - **P1 Incidents**: Aim to resolve within **1 hour**.
  - **Resolution Steps**:
    - Immediate notification to the SRE team.
    - Diagnose the issue using logs and metrics.
    - Implement fixes or rollback to the last stable state.

- **Post-Incident Review**:
  - Conduct root cause analysis for all P1 and P2 incidents.
  - Document findings and implement measures to prevent recurrence.

- **Communication Plan**:
  - Keep stakeholders informed during and after incidents.
  - Provide updates on resolution status and any user impact.

## Site Reliability Engineering Design

### 1. SRE Design

**Description**:

The SRE design focuses on scalability, automation, and resilience:

- **Automation**:
  - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use Bicep templates for consistent and repeatable deployments across environments.
  - **CI/CD Pipelines**: Implement GitHub Actions workflows to automate build, test, and deployment processes.

- **Resilience**:
  - **Fault-Tolerant Architecture**: Design the application to handle failures gracefully, including retry logic and fallback mechanisms.
  - **Redundancy**: Utilize Azure's availability zones and regions to distribute services.

- **Scalability**:
  - **Auto-Scaling**: Configure auto-scaling rules for Azure App Services and databases based on performance metrics.
  - **Resource Monitoring**: Continuously monitor resource utilization (CPU, memory) to adjust capacity proactively.

- **Collaboration**:
  - Work closely with development and operations teams to integrate SRE principles throughout the development lifecycle.
  - Conduct regular meetings to review performance metrics and address potential issues.

- **Continuous Improvement**:
  - Use data from monitoring and incidents to drive improvements in the system.
  - Implement feedback loops to refine SLOs and SLIs as needed.
