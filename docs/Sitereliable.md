# Site Reliability Engineer Documentation Template

The Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) ensures the reliability, efficiency, and scalability of the software systems by applying engineering principles to IT operations. This includes defining SLAs, SLOs, and SLIs, designing monitoring strategies, and preparing incident response plans.

## Service Level Agreement (SLA)

### 1. SLA Definition
- **Description**: Define the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the current version of the application, specifying the expected levels of service provided to the end-users. Include:
  - **Uptime Guarantee**: Percentage of time the application is guaranteed to be operational (e.g., 99.95% uptime).
  - **Response Time**: Maximum allowable response time for key services.
  - **Support Availability**: Hours of support coverage for issues.
  - **Compensation Policy**: Outline remedies for SLA violations.
- **Deliverables**:

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

### 1. SLO Definitions
- **Description**: Define five Service Level Objectives (SLOs) to ensure the SLA is met. Include objectives such as:
  1. **Frontend Availability**: Maintain 99.95% uptime for the frontend.
  2. **Backend Latency**: Ensure API response times do not exceed 2 seconds.
  3. **Database Performance**: Guarantee query response times of less than 500ms.
  4. **Error Rate**: Keep application error rates below 0.1% over a rolling 24-hour window.
  5. **Incident Resolution**: Resolve critical incidents within 1 hour of detection.
- **Deliverables**:

## Service Level Indicators (SLIs)

### 1. SLI Definitions
- **Description**: Define five Service Level Indicators (SLIs) to measure the achievement of the SLOs. Include:
  1. **Uptime**: Measure the percentage of time the frontend is available.
  2. **Response Time**: Measure average API response times.
  3. **Query Performance**: Track database query execution times.
  4. **Error Rates**: Calculate the proportion of failed requests.
  5. **Incident Response Time**: Monitor the time taken to resolve critical incidents.

## Monitoring Strategy Design

### 1. Monitoring Strategy
- **Description**: Outline the monitoring strategy to ensure the applicationâ€™s performance, availability, and reliability. Include:
  - **Monitoring Tools**: Use tools like Azure Monitor, Application Insights, and Log Analytics for tracking metrics.
  - **Alerts**: Configure alerts for key performance indicators (e.g., high response times, downtime).
  - **Dashboards**: Create real-time dashboards to visualize critical metrics.
  - **Log Analysis**: Implement log monitoring for identifying trends and potential issues.
- **Deliverables**:

## Incident Response Design

### 1. Incident Response Plan
- **Description**: Design a comprehensive incident response plan to handle system failures effectively. Include:
  - **Incident Detection**: Use monitoring tools and alerts to detect incidents promptly.
  - **Incident Triage**: Classify incidents based on severity and impact.
  - **Incident Resolution**: Define procedures for diagnosing and resolving incidents quickly.
  - **Post-Incident Review**: Conduct reviews to identify root causes and prevent recurrence.
- **Deliverables**:

## Site Reliability Engineering Design

### 1. SRE Design
- **Description**: Document the overall Site Reliability Engineering design for the project, focusing on scalability, automation, and resilience. Include:
  - **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks like deployments and scaling.
  - **Resilience**: Design fault-tolerant systems to minimize the impact of failures.
  - **Scalability**: Ensure the infrastructure can handle increasing workloads.
  - **Collaboration**: Work closely with other team members to integrate SRE principles throughout the development lifecycle.
- **Deliverables**:
