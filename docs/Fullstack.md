## Continuous Integration (CI) Workflows

### 1. CI Workflow for Frontend

**Description**  
The CI workflow for the frontend application automates the validation of code changes, ensuring any new features or updates are tested before being merged into the main branch.

**Workflow Steps**  

1. **Trigger**  
   - The workflow is triggered on:
     - Push events to the `frontend/**` directory across all branches.
     - Pull requests targeting the `main` branch.  
   - This ensures that changes to the frontend are validated at key integration points.
   ```yml
      on:
      push:
      paths:
         - "frontend/**"
      branches:
         - "*"
         - "!refs/pull/*"
   pull_request:
      branches:
         - main
      paths:
         - "frontend/**"
   ```
2. **Checkout Code**  
   - The `actions/checkout@v3` action is used to retrieve the latest codebase, ensuring that subsequent steps operate on the most recent changes.
   ```yml
     - uses: actions/checkout@v3
   ```
3. **Set Up Node.js**  
   - The workflow sets up the Node.js environment using the `actions/setup-node@v3` action.  
   - Ensures compatibility by specifying `NODE_VERSION` as `18.x`.
   ```yml
      - name: Set up Node.js
         uses: actions/setup-node@v3
         with:
         node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
   ```
4. **Install Dependencies**  
   - Dependencies are installed via `npm install` to ensure all required packages are available for testing and building.
```yml
     - name: Install Dependencies
      working-directory: ${{ env.APP_LOCATION }}
      run: npm install
   ```
5. **Run Tests**  
   - Frontend tests are executed to verify the integrity and functionality of changes.
```yml
      - name: Run Tests
      working-directory: ${{ env.APP_LOCATION }}
      run: npm test
   ```
6. **Build Application**  
   - The application is built using `npm run build`, creating an optimized production build ready for deployment.
```yml
      - name: Build Application
      working-directory: ${{ env.APP_LOCATION }}
      run: npm run build
   ```

### 2. CI Workflow for Backend

**Description**  
The backend CI workflow validates changes to backend services by running tests and static analysis, ensuring that the API and business logic remain stable.

**Workflow Steps**  

1. **Trigger**  
   - The workflow runs on:
     - Push events to the `backend/**` directory across all branches.
     - Pull requests targeting the `main` branch.
   ```yml
   on:
   push:
      paths: 
         - "backend/**"
      branches:
         - "*"
   pull_request:
      branches: [ "main" ]
      paths:
         - "backend/**"
   ```
2. **Checkout Code**  
   - Similar to the frontend workflow, this retrieves the latest code for validation.
   ```yml
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
   ```
3. **Set Up Python Environment**  
   - Python 3.11 is configured using `actions/setup-python@v3`.  
   - Compatibility with the application is maintained.
   ```yml
   - name: Set up Python 3.11
     uses: actions/setup-python@v3
     with:
      python-version: "3.11"
   ```
4. **Install Dependencies**  
   - Backend dependencies are installed using `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`.
   ```yml
   - name: Install dependencies
   run: pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Run Linting and Tests**  
   - `flake8` is used for code linting, ensuring adherence to Python coding standards.  
   - `pytest` runs backend unit tests to validate API routes and business logic.
   ```yml
   - name: Lint with flake8
   run: |
      pip install flake8 pytest
      flake8 backend/ --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
      flake8 backend/ --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics

   - name: Test with pytest
   run: python -m pytest -v
   ```

## Continuous Delivery (CD) Workflows

### 1. CD Workflow for Frontend

**Description**  
This workflow automates the deployment of the frontend application to the **Development**, **UAT**, and **Production** environments.

**Workflow Steps**  

#### Build and Deploy to Development  

1. **Setup Node.js and Build**  
   - Configures Node.js and builds the application using `npm run build`.

2. **Login to Azure and Deploy**  
   - Authenticates with Azure using `azure/login@v2`.  
   - Retrieves a static web app deployment token using `az staticwebapp secrets list`.  
   - Deploys the application to the development static web app using `Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1`.

#### Build and Deploy to UAT  

1. **Prerequisites**  
   - Deployment only occurs for:
     - Pull requests.
     - Workflow dispatch events.
     - Pushes to the `main` branch.

2. **Process**  
   - Follows the same build and deployment steps as the development environment but targets the UAT static web app.

#### Build and Deploy to Production  

1. **Trigger**  
   - Occurs when:
     - A pull request is merged to `main`.
     - Manual workflow dispatch events.  
   - Ensures that only thoroughly tested code reaches production.

2. **Deployment**  
   - Similar to UAT deployment, but targeting the production static web app.

### 2. CD Workflow for Backend

**Description**  
The backend CD workflow handles automated deployments to the **Development**, **UAT**, and **Production** environments for the backend services.

**Workflow Steps**  

#### Build and Deploy to Development  

1. **Docker Image Build and Push**  
   - Builds a Docker image for the backend service using `docker build`.  
   - Pushes the image to the Azure Container Registry (ACR) for development.

2. **Deploy to Azure App Service**  
   - Deploys the Docker container to the development App Service using `azure/webapps-deploy@v2`.

#### Build and Deploy to UAT  

1. **Image Creation and Deployment**  
   - Similar to the development deployment, but with:
     - Credentials and registry specific to the UAT environment.
     - Deployment to the UAT App Service.

2. **Requirements for UAT**  
   - Deployment is dependent on:
     - Successful image creation.
     - Triggered workflow dispatch or PR events.

#### Build and Deploy to Production  

1. **Controlled Deployment**  
   - Triggers include:
     - Push to `main` branch.
     - Manual workflow dispatch.  
   - Ensures that only stable, thoroughly tested versions are deployed.

2. **Fault Tolerance and Rollback**  
   - Ensures deployment rollback capabilities by maintaining multiple image versions in the ACR.
