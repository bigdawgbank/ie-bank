# **GitHub Hardening Strategy Documentation**
## IE Bank System GitHub Security Design Document

---

### **Introduction**

This document outlines the GitHub security strategy implemented for the IE Bank System. The goal is to secure the GitHub environment to develop safe code, protect sensitive data, and prevent unauthorized access to deployment workflows. These measures align with industry best practices and leverage advanced GitHub security features to address risks proactively.

---

### **1. GitHub Hardening Strategy**

#### **1.1 Branch Protection Rules**
- **Description:**
  - Applied branch protection rules on the `main` branch to enforce secure development practices.
- **Enforced Rules:**
  - Require pull request reviews before merging.
  - Enforce signed commits for all contributors.
  - Require all status checks to pass before merging.
- **Impact:**
  - Prevented unauthorized modifications to the `main` branch.
  - Ensured code changes are peer-reviewed for quality and security.

---

#### **1.2 Dependabot**
- **Description:**
  - Enabled Dependabot for automatic detection and resolution of dependency vulnerabilities.
- **Key Metrics:**
  - 9 open alerts, 3 resolved alerts.
  - Vulnerabilities addressed:
    - **High Severity:** Flask-CORS, Werkzeug ReDoS.
    - **Moderate Severity:** Bootstrap XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact:**
  - Ensured timely dependency updates, reducing exposure to supply chain attacks.

---

#### **1.3 CodeQL Analysis**
- **Description:**
  - Integrated CodeQL workflows to identify vulnerabilities in the codebase.
  - CodeQL was implemented for both:
    - **Frontend:** Vue.js
    - **Backend:** Python
- **Metrics:**
  - Total runs: 139 workflows.
  - Issues identified: 7 (5 resolved, 2 active).
    - **High:** Flask app running in debug mode.
    - **Medium:** Information exposure through exceptions.
- **Impact:**
  - Enabled proactive detection and resolution of vulnerabilities before deployment.

---

#### **1.4 OSSF Scorecard**
- **Description:**
  - Implemented OSSF Scorecard to evaluate repository security posture.
- **Current Status:**
  - Workflow integrated; initial scores pending.
- **Planned Impact:**
  - Evaluate adherence to best practices (branch protection, dependency updates).
  - Guide further security improvements.

---

#### **1.5 Secret Scanning & Push Protection**
- **Description:**
  - Enabled secret scanning to detect and block sensitive data (API keys, tokens).
  - Configured push protection to prevent contributors from pushing secrets to repositories.
- **Impact:**
  - Prevented accidental exposure of sensitive information.
  - Enhanced compliance with secure coding practices.

---

#### **1.6 CODEOWNERS**
- **Description:**
  - Defined code ownership rules to streamline reviews and accountability.
- **File Details:**
  - Owners assigned for specific directories:
    - **Frontend/Backend:** `@RestartDK`, `@ADRIANDLT`
    - **Infra:** `@albipuliga`, `@paulopasso`
    - **Workflows (Security):** `@Wisammad`
  - Default owner: `@Wisammad`
- **Impact:**
  - Ensured appropriate reviewers are automatically assigned for all pull requests.

---

### **2. Secrets Management**

#### **2.1 Azure Key Vault**
- **Description:**
  - Provisioned a secure Azure Key Vault using a Bicep template to manage sensitive data like API keys and database credentials.
- **Key Features:**
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for fine-grained permissions.
  - Enabled soft delete and RBAC for secure operations.
- **Usage:**
  - Secrets integrated into GitHub workflows via environment variables.
  - Automated access for deployment without exposing sensitive data in the codebase.
- **Impact:**
  - Protected critical credentials and streamlined secure application deployments.

### **3. Metrics and Results**

| **Tool**             | **Issues Found** | **Issues Resolved** | **Severity**      |
|-----------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Dependabot**        | 12               | 3                   | High, Moderate    |
| **CodeQL**            | 7                | 5                   | High, Medium      |
| **Secret Scanning**   | 0                | 0                   | (No issues found) |

---

### **4. Challenges and Lessons Learned**

#### Challenges:
- Setting up and integrating OSSF Scorecard workflows due to merging delays.
- Managing and resolving Dependabot alerts across multiple repositories.

#### Lessons Learned:
- Automation is key to consistent and scalable security practices.
- Collaboration between roles (e.g., Cloud Architect, Security Engineer) ensures smooth implementation.

---

### **5. Future Recommendations**
- Extend branch protection rules to other critical branches (e.g., feature and development branches).
- Monitor OSSF Scorecard results and implement recommendations for further improvements.
- Integrate additional tools like Trivy for container scanning and enhanced security insights.
